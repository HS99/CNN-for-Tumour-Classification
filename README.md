# Data Preparation
The data consists of many 2D "slices," which, when combined, produce a 3-dimensional rendering of whatever was scanned. In this case, that's the chest cavity of the patient. 

The database consisting of CT scans of 1400 patients was obtained from LIDC-IDRI (https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI) , and then there is another file that contains the labels for this data. CT scans of 1200 patients is used for training and the remaining for testing.
